-------------------------
The team consist of following members:
Aditya Deore, Bikramjit Singh, Mohit Aggarwal and Pradipta Ghosh


GROUP GRADING
-------------
The project was divided equally into 4 logical modules and each member was assigned ownership of a module. Each team member was responsible for implementing the missing functionality as well as coming up with test cases for their modules.
Pradipta Ghosh:		25%
Mohit Aggarwal:		25%
Bikramjit Singh:	25%
Aditya Deore:		25%
			----	
			100%


DESIGN
-------
We have implemented 39/40 functions have been in Kernel Assignment #3.
KASSERT Statements are used at appropriate locations as mentioned in the requirements document. dbg() statements are added in the code to generate console logs for debugging and testing purpose.
These logs can also be used for validating the test cases.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
The VM management is stuck in handle_pagefault. We are partially able to handle page fault.


DEVIATIONS
----------
We are not able to enter in userland. None of the test cases are working.


REFERNCES & CREDITS
-------------------
None.



TESTING GUIDELINES
------------------					
We implemented 39/40 functions  of the VM kernel assignment. 
The program is partially able to handle page_fault.
